# WinOrLoseRPS
 Rock, paper, scissors based game as a part of Paul Hudson's course

App idea was given in 100DaysOfSwiftUI course, but whole code is mine

App gives us randomly rock, paper or scissors and an information if we have to win or lose. Then we should pick the right response in order to get a point. Game ends after 10 questions. UI is rought now, but I am planning on improving it in the future
